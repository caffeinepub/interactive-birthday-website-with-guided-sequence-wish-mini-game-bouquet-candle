  "summary": "REQ-26 asks to ensure the deployment domain/slug is always compliant (5–50 chars, only letters/numbers/hyphens) so go-live/deploy does not fail due to invalid formatting. The diff adds a frontend utility to validate/sanitize slugs and sets a static HTML <title>, but there is no evidence the actual deployment domain/slug source is being enforced/blocked at the point where deployment is initiated. The changes also introduce several frontend-related additions/updates that were not requested by REQ-26 and may violate the stated constraint to avoid editing immutable frontend paths (the immutable list is not provided here, so this is noted conservatively).",

      "id": "REQ-26",
      "requirement": "Ensure the deployment domain/slug used for this app is always compliant with platform constraints (5–50 chars; only A–Z/a–z/0–9/hyphen) so deployment/go-live succeeds without domain validation errors and invalid inputs (spaces/underscores/emojis) are rejected/avoided so deployment cannot be attempted with invalid input.",
      "reason": "While a frontend helper for slug validation/sanitization was added, the diff provides no evidence that the app’s actual deployment domain/slug (the value used by the platform during go-live) is being set or enforced using this helper, nor that deployment is prevented when an invalid slug would be used.",

      "reason": "REQ-26 requires ensuring the deployment domain/slug is compliant, but does not explicitly request adding a new frontend utility module or implementing auto-sanitization/fallback behavior in the client code (and the diff does not show it being wired into the deployment mechanism).",
